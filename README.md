# Dashlane Flagged Password Mail Merge Puller
A PowerShell script that reads a CSV export of user password health scores the Dashlane Admin > Dark Web Insights > Employee emails CSV file, filters out users with poor scores, and generates a clean Excel sheet (`dashlaneflags_mailmerge.xlsx`) for use in a mail merge email.

## Features

- Reads from `team-members.csv`
